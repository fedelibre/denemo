        <_tooltip>Typesets this staff with the music from another staff, optionally in addition to its own music. Use this e.g. to create a staff with two divisi parts, while keeping the second part as a separate staff, or to typeset both Fret Diagrams and Chord Symbols from the same music. Note that initial clef/key/time are copied not mirrored. Staff number to mirror is chosen interactively or passed as a parameter to the command.</_tooltip>
